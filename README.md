# COMP6248-Reproducibility-Challenge-CapsGNN-TF
This is a public repository for Deep Learning Coursework: The COMP6248 Reproducibility Challenge in the University of Southampton. We modify some parts of the source code to make sure it is executable under windows system. During the reimplementation, I add some comments into the file to make sure it is readable.

The related source code is provided by Xinyi001 CapsGNN and the source code can be found here: https://github.com/XinyiZ001/CapsGNN.
